          Hey, I&#39;m Priyank Rajai, a technophile and an optimistic learner
          who sees opportunities in every real-life problem to solve them with
          the help of technology. From a very young age, I&#39;ve always been
          interested in tech, and science. Initially, I started web development
          out of curiosity, eventually, it became a hobby, and after many hobby
          projects (e.g. Open Source projects; read more in featured projects),
          I thought it would be cool to offer my skills to clients who want
          extraordinary web experiences, thus here we are.
        </p>
        <p className="manrope text-[16px] md:text-[18px] pt-6 pb-6">
          I&#39;m passionate about design and development, and I loved creating
          things that not only look nice but also perform well on several
          levels. I&#39;m always up for a challenge, and I strive to do better
          than is required of me. I create websites that are useful, effective,
          and serve as a great online representation of an individual or
          company. I have been building websites for more than 5 years, and I
          would love to make your digital vision a reality.
        </p>

          I do not like to define myself by the work I have done. I define
          myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, but personality
          is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself
          and do interesting things that matter.
